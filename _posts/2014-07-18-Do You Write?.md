	Do you write?

I love this slogan from [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/). And yes, I do write & write a lot, not only blogging of course.

Speaking of serious writing, these are what I want:

* Cloud-based. Yes, you know the feeling when your hardware crashed;
* Lightweight markup language yet expressive, Markdown, Textile, reStructuredText etc. but not the F**King XML for sure;
* Structural/manageable library for organizing document sets instead of single file based editor like [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/).

Under these circumstances, I found [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) at the discounted price $21.99 (as of 2014-07-18). And the conclusion it: **WORTH EVERY PENNY**.

Yes I know there are many popular ones on the AppStore for serious writing like [Evernote](https://evernote.com), [OneNote](http://www.onenote.com/), but I was not a fan of rich text format editing and probably will never be, as tuning layout during the writing will totally interrupt my thoughts. But if you have already taken quite a fancy to [WYSIWYG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG), I think [OneNote](http://www.onenote.com/) is already good enough, and, it's free.
