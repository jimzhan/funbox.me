I've been using Evernote for long already. Interestingly, on Evernote, I find myself spending almost same amount of time on organizing my notes as writing them.

It ain't cool for a developer, it ain't for an O.C.D, it ain't cool for me.

Here comes my savior:

![Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/static/images/header-mac-screenshot@2x.png)

Yeah, he is a Bear, with almost full Markdown supports (e.g. Table supports will be landing soon). Nice & intuitive interface.

**Including over 20 programming languages supports** that Evernote dropped very long time already.

|markup     | semi-disabled HTML | markdown |
|structure  | complex   | simple |
|web clip   | YES/Slow  | YES   |
|price/year | $69.99 | $14.99 |

So, as a premium member, Bye Elephant, farewell [Ulysses](/2014/07/18/Do-You-Write/)~
